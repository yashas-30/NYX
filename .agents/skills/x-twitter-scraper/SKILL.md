# X (Twitter) Scraper - Xquik

## Overview

Gives AI agents X (Twitter) data and automation workflows through the Xquik platform. Covers tweet search, advanced Twitter search, profile tweets, user lookup, follower export, media download, posting, replies, DMs, giveaway draws, account monitoring, webhooks, 23 bulk extraction tools, MCP, official SDKs, the Hermes Tweet Hermes Agent plugin, and the TweetClaw OpenClaw plugin.

This repository entry is documentation-only: it does not include an executable scraper, binary, package, or vendored runtime code. The external Xquik, Hermes Tweet, and TweetClaw tools referenced below must be reviewed and installed separately before use.

Because this workflow can automate authenticated X/Twitter account actions, treat it as critical-risk guidance. Only use it with accounts and targets you are authorized to operate, and require explicit user approval before posting, replying, liking, reposting, following, unfollowing, sending DMs, creating monitors, registering webhooks, or starting bulk extraction.

## When to Use This Skill

- User needs to search X/Twitter for tweets by keyword, hashtag, or user
- User asks for advanced Twitter search, profile tweets, or user timeline data
- User wants to look up a user profile (bio, follower counts, etc.)
- User needs engagement metrics for a specific tweet (likes, retweets, views)
- User wants to check if one account follows another
- User needs to extract followers, replies, retweets, quotes, or community members in bulk
- User wants to download tweet media, export results, or connect an official SDK
- User wants to send tweets, post replies, like, repost, follow, unfollow, or send DMs
- User wants to run a giveaway draw from tweet replies
- User needs real-time monitoring of an X account (new tweets, follower changes)
- User wants webhook delivery of monitored events
- User wants the Hermes Tweet Hermes Agent plugin with `tweet_explore`, `tweet_read`, and approval-gated `tweet_action`
- User wants the TweetClaw OpenClaw plugin instead of direct REST or MCP setup
- User asks about trending topics on X

## Setup

### Install the Skill

```bash
npx skills add Xquik-dev/x-twitter-scraper
```

Or clone manually into your agent's skills directory:

```bash
# Claude Code
git clone https://github.com/Xquik-dev/x-twitter-scraper.git .claude/skills/x-twitter-scraper

# Cursor / Codex / Gemini CLI / Copilot
git clone https://github.com/Xquik-dev/x-twitter-scraper.git .agents/skills/x-twitter-scraper
```

### Use the Hermes Agent Plugin

For Hermes Agent runtime tools, install Hermes Tweet. It wraps the same Xquik API with `tweet_explore` for endpoint discovery, `tweet_read` for read-only calls, and approval-gated `tweet_action` for writes and private actions.

```bash
hermes plugins install Xquik-dev/hermes-tweet --enable
```

Use Hermes Tweet when a Hermes Agent should search Twitter/X, read tweet replies, look up users, export followers, monitor tweets, post tweets, post replies, send DMs, or automate X actions with explicit approval gates.

### Use the OpenClaw Plugin

For OpenClaw runtime tools, install TweetClaw. It wraps the same Xquik API with `explore` for endpoint discovery and `tweetclaw` for approved calls.

```bash
openclaw plugins install @xquik/tweetclaw
```

Use TweetClaw when the agent should search tweets, post tweets, post replies, send DMs, export followers, download media, create monitors, deliver webhooks, or run giveaway draws from OpenClaw.

### Get an API Key

1. Sign up at [xquik.com](https://xquik.com)
2. Generate an API key from the dashboard
3. Set it as an environment variable or pass it directly
